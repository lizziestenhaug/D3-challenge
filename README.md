## Background

The data setis based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

With this data I created a graph using D3.js analyzing median age and percentage of smokers across the different states in the US. 

I concluded the following:
1) most of the states fall in the middle of median age between 36 and 40 and have between 12 and 22% of people who smoke.
2) Wyoming has the highest % smoking rate and is in the top 5 for median age.
3) Utah has the lowest smoking % as well as the lowest median age.
